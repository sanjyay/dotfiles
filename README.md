# Firefox Lumina
A userstylesheet dark theme for Firefox, designed for using with Tree Style Tabs.

## Design Aspects
- A browser theme should distract the user from the content of the page they are viewing.
- The browser theme should mix elegantly with most modern websites (eg: youtube, google, duckduckgo, github etc)
- Vertical Tabs > Horizontal Tabs
