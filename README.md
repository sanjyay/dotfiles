# Firefox Lumina
A userstylesheet dark theme for Firefox, designed for using with Tree Style Tabs.

## Design Aspects
- A browser theme should distract the user from the content of the page they are viewing.
- The browser theme should mix elegantly with most modern websites (eg: youtube, google, duckduckgo, github etc)
- Vertical Tabs > Horizontal Tabs
- Rounded elements look better

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mastermach50/firefox-lumina.git
```
2. Copy the `chrome` folder into your firefox user profile folder
> Remember to backup your current chrome folder if it exists

## Issues
I want to modify every part of firefox to make it look seamless, you can file an issue if some part of firefox is not themed.
